## Introduction

This project focuses on learning a few important functions in C by simulating the shell pipe operator by creating our own simulation of the shell redirection using pipe(), fork(), dup2(), and execve(). Those functions serve as the backbone of this entire project, learning to use them and understand their functionality well is crucial to making this project work perfectly. 

The mandatory part of the project works with an input file, 2 commands, and an output file.

The bonus part of the project works with an input file, n commands, and an output file.

## Usage

- Clone Project
- Make project using 'make all' or 'make bonus'
- Use './pipex' to use the program, it will take one input file, 2 commands that will be piped together, and an output file.
